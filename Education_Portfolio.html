<p>&nbsp;For 7 years of my life, or roughly 35% of my life, I attended DSA (AKA Durham School of the Arts). Here, I was introduced to and learned to have a passion for the arts. Starting off with&nbsp; theatre and visual arts, I realized quickly enough they were not my forte. However, a school of arts had countless other areas, and it was in music that I excelled. For 7 years I took band courses at DSA, and for four of them, I took two at once. Sitting in those classes, I increasingly realized that I enjoy music. I explored from concert band&nbsp; to jazz band, and for my finally 3 years at the school I performed in the jazz artistry class (small jazz combo).&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, I took full orchestra electives, volunteered for performances (like musicals), and with my band, gained a superior rating each year at MPA (a band competition). This was expected at DSA.Outside of the arts, DSA was also academically rigorous in many ways. Whether it was AP classes or extracurriculars, there was always something to challenge yourself, and this I did. DSA not only brought me an enjoyment of the arts, but it also provided me entertainment in learning and education. Even after my graduation in 2022, this mindset is still part of my life. I may not go to DSA now, but I will always be a bulldog for life.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After my Graduation from DSA, I decided instead of moving away to college, I would stay right where I was so that I could spend whatever time I had left with my father, who had cancer. This led me to take community college classes, as they were close, efficient, and there for me when I needed them. After my younger brother (who is very passionate about the qualities of community college) convinced me this was THE option to further my education, I decided that I would take classes at community college in the Fall of 2022. It was at this point&nbsp; that I started my journey a Durham Technical Community College. It was at this point that I decided I might have another passion: computer science. While I didn't really have much of a preference for my future as I attended Durham Tech, I took classes pertaining to science and math. After taking the necessary&nbsp; classes for my Associate of Science, such as Calculus III, and some fun classes such as Jazz History, I moved closer to my goal, which is to transfer to UNC-Chapel Hill.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Now I am additionally a visiting student at Wake Tech. It is here that I am able to obtain some of the computer science classes courses that were not offered at Durham Tech. Slowly but surely, I am taking all the computer science courses that I need at Wake Tech, pursuing my almost-cemented goal of joining UNC-Chapel Hill's Computer Science Program. I hope to better my knowledge in programming, and also to pursue my passion in music with UNC-Chapel Hill's jazz program.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
