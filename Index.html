	 <p>Hello, my name is Robert Ross, and welcome to my Portfolio Assignment. I am a 19 year old college student attending community college and I am taking&nbsp; &nbsp;college courses on the side as I enjoy my summer. I am passionate about music, specifically jazz, and have a great appreciation for the arts, whether it be painting, music, or video game design. I am a self taught musician, and over the years I have learned to play clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, EWI (electrical wind instrument), piano, and most recently, the melodica. Learning music is fun to me, and so is the prospect of programming. As grow in these areas I hope to be able to share them with the world, whether it's as a teacher, friend, or parent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> Welcome to my website. On this website you will be able to find my contact information, which can be found at the bottom or at the top via the contact information bar. You will be able to learn about a little of who I am as I delve into my education, passions, and experience. Through this website I hope to be able to introduce myself to the world, make connections, and improve my web design skills. I&nbsp; implore you to&nbsp; &nbsp; share in my passions of music and get to know who I am better. Do not be afraid to ask questions, as I am not one to stifle learning. I plan to update and add more to this website and I encourage you to come back. Have fun!</p>
