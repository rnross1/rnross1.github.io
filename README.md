# This repository contains the 4 html files for my portfolio assignment. These files are index.html, Work_Experience.html, Education_Portfolio.hmtl, and contact_information_page.html.
# To clone this repository after I made it in Git Hub, I used the GitHub desktop application. Using the application I cloned the repository rnross1.github.io and used the newly created file to drop my 4 html files into. After this I commited to main and clicked on the "push origin" button.
